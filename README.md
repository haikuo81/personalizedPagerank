#personalized pagerank
Working on personalized pagerank for my thesis, using jgrapht library for graph stuff.
The objective of the thesis is to investigate, develop and compare algorithms to give an approximation of a personalized pagerank for each node. (since running the "normal" pagerank for each node is too costly).    

An evaluation of the first algorithm can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11-efv9CQ_mQ5qS_Bo7KAKK9rNeBmMroEgGoyz4_S_Js/edit?usp=sharing (charts and csv data can found in the "data" directory of this project).
