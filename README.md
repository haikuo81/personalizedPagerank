#personalized pagerank
Working on personalized pagerank for my thesis, using jgrapht library for graph stuff, fastutil for hashmaps since the default java ones are too slow and too garbage producing.  
The objective of the thesis is to investigate, develop and compare algorithms to give an approximation of a personalized pagerank for each node. (since running the "normal" pagerank for each node is too costly).    

As of now 2 algorithms have been implemented and evaluated, you can find the results of the evaluations in the following links:
